* http://tranexp.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

Translates words or phrases from one language to another, using 
http://www.tranexp.com:2000/Translate/result.shtml

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Has a command-line and API.

Caches results in a local YAML file to make subsequent requests for
same query faster. (REQUIRES: 'HOME' environment variable set to a folder)

=== Command Line

To translate some text from Danish to English:

    cat some_danish_text.txt | tranexp dan eng
    
    echo "jeg ville like en flaske vin" | tranexp nor
    I would like a bottle of wine

That is, you pass the input text via STDIN. The default target language is English ('eng').

=== API

To translate some text from English to Norwegian:
  
    translate = Tranexp::Http.new
    english = translate.translate("metoder", Tranexp::Http::Norwegian, Tranexp::Http::English)
    english = translate.translate("metoder", "nor", "eng")
    
Or use the dynamic helper:
  
    translate.from_nor_to_eng("metoder")
